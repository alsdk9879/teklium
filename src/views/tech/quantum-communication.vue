    p Quantum security is absolute, based on fundamental physical laws. By leveraging entangled particles such as photons, quantum communication offers unprecedented security. BB84 and other quantum key distribution protocols use the no-cloning theorem to safeguard keys even if qubits are intercepted in the process of creating shared secret keys. Implementing quantum communication infrastructure requires specialized hardware, precise environmental control, and cryogenic temperatures, posing significant technical challenges.
    p The advent of carbon semiconductors is ushering in an era when emulated quantum communication is accessible for everyday use, offering robust security features comparable to traditional quantum communication. Metacognitive AI (MAI) algorithms, such as Tapestry Exchange and Genetic Computing, have been developed by Teklium to emulate quantum communications. The Tapestry Exchange mirrors the quantum key distribution model, enabling the establishment of private keys over public channels without sharing secrets, while the Genetic Computing model manages the secure access to data using quantum entanglement principles.
    p By late 2024, Teklium plans to release emulated quantum communication software, which will be integrated into a variety of secure communication tools and services. A quantum communication emulated core will be incorporated into Teklium's CNT chips developed with Nantero, boosting performance and security and enabling the transformation of the internet.
