    p A typical CPU comprises three core functional components: a memory management unit (MMU), a control unit, and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The MMU oversees memory access across internal cache, memory chips, and storage devices when loading programs or retrieving data. Meanwhile, the control unit decodes instructions, manages data flow, and coordinates interactions between components, while the ALU performs arithmetic (e.g., addition, subtraction) and logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT). To optimize performance, the control unit and ALU divide instructions into sequential stages for efficient processing, although pipeline stalls—caused by data dependencies, system calls, or errors—can lead to idle periods known as "pipeline bubbles."
    p Teklium is advancing semiconductor technology with its Memory-Mapped CPU, utilizing CSCC architecture and Nantero's CNT technology. This innovative design integrates CPU and memory into a single chip to enhance performance significantly. CNT chips, with their 3D structure, provide ten times more memory cells than silicon memory chips. Memory-mapped CPUs expedite complex computations by converting specific CPU pipeline functions into dynamic memory tables, yielding near-instantaneous results. Utilizing these CPUs, tensor operations directly execute on CNT memory, offering GPU-level performance with just 10% of the power consumption. Additionally, memory-mapped CPUs optimize energy efficiency and resource allocation by distributing computing tasks across multiple CPUs. The advanced CNT technology enables genuine parallel processing, effectively addressing data contention issues and representing a notable breakthrough in semiconductor development.
